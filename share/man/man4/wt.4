.Sh NAME
.Nm wt
.Nd Archive/Wangtek cartridge tape driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wt0 at isa? port 0x300 irq 5 drq 1"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the following Archive and Wangtek boards:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Dv -offset indent -compact
.It QIC-02
.It QIC-36
.El
.Pp
Raw devices are indicated by an
.Dq r
preceding the device name.
The driver can be opened with either rewind on close
.Pq Pa "/dev/rst*"
or no rewind on close
.Pq Pa "/dev/nrst*"
options.
.Pp
The tape format is specified by adding 8 or 16 to the device number.
For example, for the wt0 device's raw rewind on close device nodes,
.Pa /dev/rwt0
is the 150 MByte density device,
.Pa /dev/rwt8
is the 120 MByte density device, and
.Pa /dev/rwt16
is the 60 MByte device.

.Xr intro 4
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver conflicts unpleasantly with the
.Nm we
driver (SMC
.Tn Ethernet
adapters) at the same I/O address.  The probe reprograms their EEPROMs.
