.Sh NAME
.Nm virt
.Nd rump virtual network interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In rump/rump.h
.Ft int
.Fo rump_pub_virtif_create
.Fa "int num"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface acts as a link between a rump virtual kernel and a host
.Xr tap 4
interface.
Interface number <n> always corresponds with the host tap interface tap<n>.
All data sent by
.Nm
is written into
.Pa /dev/tap<n>
and all data read from
.Pa /dev/tap<n>
is passed as Ethernet input to the rump virtual kernel.
.Pp
A
.Nm
interface can be created in two ways:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Programmatically by calling
.Fn rump_pub_virtif_create .
.It
Dynamically at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or equivalent using the
.Em create
command.
.El
.Pp
Destroying a
.Nm
interface is possible only through
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Em destroy .
.Pp
The host's
.Xr tap 4
interface can be further bridged with hardware interfaces to provide
full Internet access to a rump kernel.
