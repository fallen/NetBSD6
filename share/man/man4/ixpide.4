.Sh NAME
.Nm ixpide
.Nd PCI IDE disk controllers driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ixpide* at pci? dev ? function ? flags 0x0000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the ATI Technologies IXP IDE controller, and provides the
interface with the hardware for the
.Xr ata 4
driver.
.Pp
The 0x0002 flag forces the
.Nm
driver to disable DMA on chipsets for which DMA would normally be
enabled.
This can be used as a debugging aid, or to work around
problems where the IDE controller is wired up to the system incorrectly.
.Sh HARDWARE
The supported IDE controllers are
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
ATI SB200

ATI SB300

ATI SB400, Parallel ATA

.Sh CAVEATS
Some SB700 controllers can hang under load when Native IDE mode is
selected in the system BIOS, but work fine in AHCI mode.
