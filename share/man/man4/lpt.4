.Sh NAME
.Nm lpt
.Nd generic printer device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lpt* at ppbus?"
.Cd options LPT_DEBUG
.Cd options LPT_VERBOSE
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver is the port of the lpt driver to the
.Xr ppbus 4
system.
.Pp
The purpose of this driver is to allow parallel port sharing with
other parallel devices.
See
.Xr ppbus 4
for more information about the parallel port bus system.
.Pp
The parallel port bus is reserved by
.Nm
when the printer device is opened and released when the device is
closed.
.Pp
Ports can be configured to use interrupts, DMA, IEEE negotiations, and IEEE
compliant transfer modes by using the
.Xr lptctl 8
command, with modes depending on the hardware available.

.Xr mknod 8
.Sh HISTORY
This driver is derived from the
.Fx
ppbus and also from the historic
.Nx
drivers.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver used to assign special meaning for some bits of device minor.
This was dropped in ppbus-based
.Nm
in favour of configuration via
.Xr lptctl 8 .
.Sh AUTHORS
This manual page was based on the
.Fx
.Nm lpt
manual page.
The information has been updated for the
.Nx
port by Gary Thorpe.
