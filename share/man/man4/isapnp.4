.Sh NAME
.Nm isapnp
.Nd introduction to ISA Plug-and-Play support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "isapnp0 at isa?"
.Pp
An
.Nm
bus can be configured for each supported ISA bus.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nx
provides machine-independent bus support and
drivers for ISA Plug-and-Play (isapnp) autoconfiguration of
PnP-compatible
devices on an ISA bus.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
.Nx
includes machine-independent ISAPNP drivers, sorted by function
and driver name:
.Ss SCSI interfaces

.It sb
SoundBlaster, SoundBlaster 16, and SoundBlaster Pro sound cards.
.It wss
Windows Sound System compatible cards, e.g., most of the cards
with Crystal Semiconductor chips.
.It ym

.Bl -tag -width pcdisplay -offset indent
.It pcic
.Tn PCI
.Tn PCMCIA

.El
.Pp
ISA Plug-and-Play devices also have alternate ISA drivers with
static ISA IO address configuration.
These are listed in
.Xr isa 4 .
The
.Nm
bus ignores devices that have already been found and configured as
.Xr isa 4
devices.
The
.Nm
bus is only effective on machines which lack a PnP BIOS, or  on
which the PnP BIOS has been disabled.
The manual pages for each individual
.Nm
driver also list
the supported front-ends for other buses.
