.Sh NAME
.Nm auvitek
.Nd Auvitek AU0828 video capture device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "auvitek* at uhub?"
.Cd "dtv* at dtvbus?"
.Cd "video* at videobus?"
.Cd "uaudio* at auvitek?"
.Cd "audio* at uaudio?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for
.Tn USB
video capture devices based on the Auvitek AU0828 bridge.
This hybrid analog/digital device requires a hi-speed USB host controller
(such as
.Xr ehci 4 )
to function properly.
.Pp
For
.Nm
devices with analog audio capture interfaces, the
.Xr uaudio 4
device driver provides access to the audio stream.
Application software can find a
.Xr video 4
device's
.Xr audio 4
device by comparing the
.Dv VIDIOC_QUERYCAP
.Va bus_info
field with the audio device's
.Dv AUDIO_GETDEV
.Va config
field.
.Pp
The following cards are supported by the
.Nm
driver:
.Pp
.Bl -column -offset indent \
"Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-950Q  " \
"              " \
"              "

.It "Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-950Q" Ta Xr au8522 4 Ta Xr xc5k 4
.El
.Pp
Cards with an XC5000 tuner require the firmware provided by the
.Pa pkgsrc/sysutils/xc5k-firmware
package to function properly.
