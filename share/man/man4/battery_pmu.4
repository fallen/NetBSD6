.Sh NAME
.Nm battery_pmu
.Nd support for batteries and sensors in PCI-based Apple Powerbooks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "battery* at pmu?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for batteries and hardware sensors found
in first generation PCI-based PowerBooks (i.e. Apple Powerbook
2400, 3400 and 3500 (also known as Original PowerBook G3).
Currently it only exports a few sensors via the
.Xr envsys 4
interface, including battery charge, voltage, CPU and battery
temperature and AC power availability.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr envsys 4 ,
.Xr pmu 4 ,
.Xr envstat 8
.Sh BUGS
There is no APM emulation right now and the battery current sensor
may return misleading or wrong data.
This driver is considered preliminary and may be replaced at some
point.
