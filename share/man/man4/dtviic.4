.Nd Inter IC (I2C) modules for DTV
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
modules provide support for
.Xr dtv 4
devices.
The
.Nm
module group includes tuners, demodulators, and analog video decoders.
.Pp
The usual hardware structure consists of a host controller
(connected for instance via
.Xr usb 4
or
.Xr pci 4 )
that provides the data moving facilities (for the analog or
digital video streams) and an
.Xr iic 4
bus over which the other chips can be configured.
.Pp
For example, a typical
.Xr dtv 4
setup would look like this:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
Initialize transport stream
.Pq Dv TS
port on the host controller.
.It
Configure the demodulator that
.Dq demodulates
the information from an intermediate frequency
.Pq Dv IF
that is provided to it by the associated tuner.
This step typically includes setting the desired
quadrature amplitude modulation
.Pq Dv QAM
and bandwidth, among other things.
.It
Configure the tuner.
Typically this step includes at least setting the frequency.
.It
Start TS transfer (using
.Dv DMA
transfers or
.Dv USB
high speed transfers).
