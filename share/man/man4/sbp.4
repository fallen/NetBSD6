.Sh NAME
.Nm sbp
.Nd Serial Bus Protocol 2 (SBP-2) Mass Storage Devices driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sbp* at ieee1394if? euihi ? euilo ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for SBP-2 devices that attach to the IEEE1394 port.
It should work with all SBP-2 devices which the
.Xr scsi 4
layer supports, for example,
HDDs, CDROM drives, and DVD drives.
.Pp
Some users familiar with
.Xr umass 4
might wonder why the device is not detached at the
.Xr scsi 4
layer when the device is unplugged.
It is detached only if the device has not been plugged again during several
bus resets.
This is for preventing to detach an active file system even when the device
cannot be probed correctly for some reason after a bus reset or when the
device is temporary disconnected because the user changes the bus topology.
If you want to force to detach the device, run
.Ic fwctl -r
several times.
