.Sh NAME
.Nm fwip
.Nd IP over IEEE1394 driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "fwip* at ieee1394if?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides standard IP over IEEE1394 based on the
protocols described in RFC 2734 and RFC 3146.
.Pp
The
.Xr ieee1394if 4
and
.Xr fwohci 4
drivers must be configured in the kernel as well.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr arp 4 ,
.Xr fwohci 4 ,
.Xr ieee1394if 4 ,
.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 5.3 .
It was added to
.Nx 4.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver and this manual page were written by
.An Doug Rabson ,
based on earlier work by
.An Hidetoshi Shimokawa .
It was added to
.Nx 4.0
by
.An KIYOHARA Takashi .
.Sh BUGS
This driver currently does not support the MCAP protocol for multicast
IP over IEEE1394.
Multicast packets are treated as broadcast packets which is sufficient
for most trivial uses of multicast.
