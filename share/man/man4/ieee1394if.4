.Sh NAME
.Nm ieee1394if
.Nd IEEE1394 High-performance Serial Bus
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ieee1394if* at fwohci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nx
provides machine-independent bus support and raw drivers for IEEE1394
interfaces.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver consists of two layers: the controller and the
bus layer.
The controller attaches to a physical bus
(like
.Xr pci 4 ) .
The
.Nm
bus attaches to the controller.
Additional drivers can be attached to the bus.
.Pp
Up to 63 devices, including the host itself, can be attached to
a IEEE1394 bus.
The root node is dynamically assigned with a PHY device function.
Also, the other IEEE1394 bus specific parameters,
e.g., node ID, cycle master, isochronous resource manager and bus
manager, are dynamically assigned, after bus reset is initiated.
On the
.Nm
bus, every device is identified by an EUI 64 address.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 5.0 ,
as
.Ic firewire .
It was added to
.Nx 4.0
under its present name.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Katsushi Kobayashi
and
.An Hidetoshi Shimokawa
for the
.Fx
project.
It was added to
.Nx 4.0
by
.An KIYOHARA Takashi .
