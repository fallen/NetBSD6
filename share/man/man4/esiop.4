.Sh NAME
.Nm esiop
.Nd Enhanced Symbios Logic/NCR 53c8xx SCSI driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "esiop* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "options SIOP_SYMLED"
.Cd "scsibus* at esiop?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides improved support over
.Xr siop 4
for the Symbios Logic/NCR 53x8xx series of
.Tn SCSI
controller chips:
.Pp
.Bl -dash -compact -offset indent
.It
53c825 and 53c825a (Fast-Wide
.Tn SCSI )
.It
53c875 and 53c875j (Ultra-Wide
.Tn SCSI )
.It
53c876 (Dual Ultra-Wide
.Tn SCSI )
.It
53c885 (Ultra-Wide
.Tn SCSI
and
.Tn Ethernet )
.It
53c895 (Ultra2-Wide
.Tn SCSI )
.It
53c896 (PCI 64bit, dual Ultra2-Wide
.Tn SCSI )
.It
53c1010-33 (PCI 64bit, dual Ultra160
.Tn SCSI )
.It
53c1510d (PCI 64bit, dual Ultra2-wide
.Tn SCSI )
.El
Older adapters are supported by the
.Xr siop 4
driver.
.Pp
The SIOP_SYMLED option causes the driver to report SCSI activity on the GPIO
pin 1, which is connected to the activity LED on some adapters. At this time
only the 53c895 based Symbios and Tekram adapters are known to require this.
