.Sh NAME
.Nm geodecntr
.Nd AMD Geode SC1100 High Resolution Counter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "geodegcb*  at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "geodecntr* at geodegcb?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the
.Tn AMD
SC1100
controllers
and provides a timecounter implementation for the 27MHz
counter.
.Pp
The other timing sources in the SC1100 suffer from
power management features that prohibit i8254 and TSC
from being used for time keeping.
This
.Nm
driver
makes the 27MHz counter available for the
.Xr timecounter 9
framework.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr timecounter 9
