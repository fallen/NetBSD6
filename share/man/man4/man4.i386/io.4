.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This device is obsolete and is provided for compatibility purposes
only; use
.Xr i386_iopl 2
instead.
.Ef
.Pp
After opening
.Pa /dev/io
for writing
the process is granted full I/O privileges; closing the returned file
descriptor does
.Em not
result in revocation of these privileges.
The new I/O privileges can be useful in order to write userland
programs that handle some hardware directly.
.Pp
The entire access control is handled by the file access permissions
of
.Pa /dev/io ,
so care should be taken in granting rights for this device.
.Pp
I/O privilege on access to
.Pa /dev/io
is only granted if the kernel was built with the
.Dv COMPAT_10
option.

.Sh HISTORY

file appeared in

after it was in the kernel for some time.
