.Sh NAME
.Nm hpacel
.Nd HP 3D DriveGuard accelerometer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hpacel* at acpi?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports accelerometers that are
commonly available in Hewlett-Packard laptops.
The supported chip is
.Dv LIS3LV02DL
from STMicroelectronics, although other chips from the same family, such as
.Dv LIS3LV02DQ ,
may also work, provided that the vendor has implemented suitable
.Dv ACPI
access methods.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver reports the acceleration readings of the X-, Y-, and Z-axis
via the
.Xr envsys 4
.Tn API
and the
.Xr envstat 8
command.

.Sh BUGS
The used accelerometer chip is capable of generating wake-up,
direction detection, and free-fall interrupts.
In the ideal situation these could be used to evoke possible emergency action.
However, the
.Nm
driver only reports the readings from the accelerometer via
.Xr sysmon_envsys 9 .
