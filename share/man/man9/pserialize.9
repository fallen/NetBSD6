.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/pserialize.h
.Ft pserialize_t
.Fn pserialize_create "void"
.Ft void
.Fn pserialize_destroy "pserialize_t psz"
.Ft int
.Fn pserialize_read_enter "void"
.Ft void
.Fn pserialize_read_exit "int s"
.Ft void
.Fn pserialize_perform "pserialize_t psz"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Passive serialization is a reader / writer synchronisation mechanism
designed for lock-less read operations.
The read operations may happen from software interrupt at
.Dv IPL_SOFTCLOCK .
.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn pserialize_create
Allocate a new synchronisation object.
.It Fn pserialize_destroy
Destroy the synchronisation object.
No synchronisation activity should happen at this point.
.It Fn pserialize_read_enter
Enter the critical path of the reader side.
Returns an IPL value, which must be passed to
.Xr pserialize_read_exit 9 .
Protected code path is not allowed to block.
.It Fn pserialize_read_exit
Exit the critical path of the reader side.
Takes the IPL value returned by
.Xr pserialize_read_enter 9 .
.It Fn pserialize_perform
Perform the passive serialization on the writer side.
Passing of this function ensures that no readers are in action.
Writers must be additionally serialized with a separate mechanism,
e.g.
.Xr mutex 9 .
Operation blocks and it may only be performed from thread context.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Typical code fragment in the writer side:
.Bd -literal
	mutex_enter(\*[Am]writer_psz_lock);
	/*
	 * Perform the updates (e.g. remove data items from a list).
	 */
	...
	pserialize_perform(object-\*[Gt]psz);
	/*
	 * At this point it is safe to destroy old data items.
	 */
	mutex_exit(\*[Am]writer_psz_lock);
