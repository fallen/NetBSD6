.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.In stdlib.h
header defines the following types and macros:
.Bl -enum -offset 4n
.It
.Dv NULL
- an implementation-defined null pointer constant;
.It
.Vt size_t
and
.Vt wchar_t
- integer types described in
.Xr stddef 3 ;
.It
.Vt div_t ,
.Vt ldiv_t ,
and
.Vt lldiv_t
- structures that are returned by the
.Xr div 3 ,
.Xr ldiv 3 ,
and
.Xr lldiv 3
functions, respectively;
.It
.Dv RAND_MAX
- a macro which expands to an integer constant
that is the maximum value returned by the
.Xr rand 3
function;
.It
.Dv MB_CUR_MAX
- an integer expression of type
.Vt size_t
whose value is the maximum number of bytes in a
character specified by the current locale; and
.It
.Dv EXIT_SUCCESS
and
.Dv EXIT_FAILURE
- macros which expand to integer constants
suitable for use as an argument to the
.Xr exit 3
function.
.El
.Pp
The
.In stdlib.h
header also prototypes several important functions such as
.Xr abort 3 ,
.Xr atoi 3 ,
.Xr bsearch 3 ,
.Xr free 3 ,
.Xr malloc 3 ,
and
.Xr strtol 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr types 3 ,
.Xr unistd 3
.Sh STANDARDS

.In stdlib.h
header conforms to
.St -isoC-99
and
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
.Sh HISTORY
