.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Power fail and crash recovery
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed
as described in
.Xr fsck 8 ,
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.Ss Cold starts
A disk-boot program
.Pa ( /usr/mdec/ufsboot )
will attempt to load
.Pa netbsd
from partition A of the boot device,
which must currently be an
.Dq sd
disk.
Alternatively, network boot program
.Pa ( /usr/mdec/netboot )
will load
.Pa netbsd
from the NFS root as determined by the procedure described in
.Xr diskless 8 .
.Ss Boot program options
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.It Fl a
Prompt for the root file system device, the system crash dump
device, and the path to
.Xr init 8 .
.It Fl d
Bring the system up in debug mode.
Here it waits for a kernel debugger connect; see
.Xr ddb 4 .
.It Fl q
Boot the system in quiet mode.
.It Fl s
Bring the system up in single-user mode.
.It Fl v
Boot the system in verbose mode.
.El
.Pp
Any extra flags or arguments, or the
.Aq Ar boot string
after the -- separator are passed to the boot PROM.
Other flags are currently ignored.
.Pp
At any time you can break back to the ROM by pressing the
.Sq L1
and
.Sq a
keys at the same time (if the console is a serial port the same is
achieved by sending a
.Sq break ) .
If you do this accidentally you can continue whatever was in progress
by typing
.Sq c
followed by the return key.
