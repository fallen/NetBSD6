.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The ISO Transport Protocol implemented for AOS R2
at the University of Wisconsin - Madison
includes classes 0 and 4 
of the ISO transport protocols
as specified in
the September 1984 version of DIS 8073.
Class 4 of the protocol provides reliable, sequenced,
flow-controlled, two-way
transmission of data packets with an alternate stop-and-wait data path called
the "expedited data" service.
Class 0 is essentially a null transport protocol, which is used
when the underlying network service provides reliable, sequenced,
flow-controlled, two-way data transmission.
Class 0 does not provide the expedited data service.
The protocols are implemented as a single transport layer entity 
that coexists with the Internet protocol suite.
Class 0 may be used only in the ISO domain.
Class 4 may be used in the Internet domain as well as in the ISO domain.
.PP
The user interface to this protocol is the Berkeley interprocess communication
interface (see \fIsocket(2)\fR.)
Two new system calls for sending and receiving
were added to this interface to
to permit the support the end-of-transport-service-data-unit (EOTSDU)
indication. 
See \fIsendv(2)\fR and \fIrecvv(2)\fR.
If the EOTSDU is not needed, the Berkeley 4.3BSD interface
can be used. 
See \fIsend(2)\fR and \fIrecv(2)\fR.
.PP
Through the 
\fIgetsockopt\fR and \fIsetsockopt\fR
system calls,
TP supports several options 
to control such things as negotiable options
in the protocol and protocol strategies.
.\"These system calls are used
.\"to submit data for inclusion on connect and disconnect TPDUs. 
The options are defined in \fB<netargo/tp_user.h>\fR,
and are described below.
.\".PP
.\"The options marked with a percent sign ( \fB%\fR )
.\"are limited to use by the super-user.
.PP
In the tables below,
the options marked with a pound sign ( \fB#\fR )
may be used 
with \fIsetsockopt()\fR
after a connection is established.
Others must be used before the connection
is established, in other words,
before calling
\fIconnect()\fR or 
\fIaccept()\fR.
All options may be used 
with \fIgetsockopt()\fR
before or
after a connection is established.
.\"
.\" .PP
.\" The options marked with an exclamation point ( \fB!\fR )
.\" may be used after a connection is released,
.\" but before 
.\" the TP reference timer (which generally
.\" has a value in minutes) expires, and before
.\" a \fIclose()\fR system call.
.\" In other words, these commands may be used when the peer closes
.\" a connection (possibly causing a disconnect indication), as long as the command
.\" is issued "soon" after the disconnection occurred.  
.\" Disconnect data may be sent by the side initiating the close
.\" but not by the passive side ("passive" with respect to the closing
.\" of the connection), so there is no need to read disconnect data
.\" after calling \fIclose()\fR.
.\" .PP
.\" The implementation of data on connect and disconnect is incomplete
.\" and is not supported.

TPOPT_MY_TSEL\fB \fR
1-64 bytes.
.IP
An "extended" transport selector (tsel) for this socket.
This option is used to set or get the local tsel.
When this option is used to set a tsel, 
the default the 2-byte tsel
that may have been allocated by \fIbind()\fR
is retained, but this "extended" tsel is the
tsel that is transmitted in a connection request
When this option is used to get a tsel, 
it will return whatever transport tsel exists;
if no "extended" tsel was given to this socket,
the 2-byte tsel is returned.
.TP 25
TPOPT_PEER_TSEL\fB \fR
1-64 bytes.
.IP
An "extended" transport selector (tsel) for the
peer transport entity.
This option is used to get the peer's tsel after
a connection is established. 
When used before a connection
is established, this option can set the tsel that
will be transmitted as the "called" tsel
in a connection request.
.TP 25
TPOPT_PERF_MEAS\fB #\fR
Boolean.
.IP
When \fBtrue\fR, performance measurements will be kept
for this connection.  
When set before a connection is established, the
active side will use a locally defined parameter on the
connect request packet; if the peer is another ARGO
implementation, this will cause performance measurement to be
turned on 
on the passive side as well.
See \fItpperf(8)\fR.

p_winsize
short integer between 128 and 16384. [4096 bytes]
.IP
The buffer space limits in bytes for incoming and outgoing data.
There is no way to specify different limits for incoming and outgoing
paths.
The actual window size at any time
during the lifetime of a connection
is a function of the buffer size limit, the negotiated
maximum TPDU size, and the 
rate at which the user program receives data.
This parameter applies only to class 4.
.\" ******************8
.TP 25
p_tpdusize
unsigned char between 0x7 and 0xd. 
[ 0xc for class 4 ] [ 0xb for class 0 ]
.IP
Log 2 of the maximum TPDU size to be negotiated.
The TP standard (ISO 8473) gives an upper bound of 
0xd for class 4 and 0xb for class 0.
The ARGO implementation places upper bounds of
0xc on class 4 and 0xb on class 0.

.IP
This parameter applies only to class 4.
Two acknowledgment strategies are supported:
.IP
TPACK_EACH means that each data TPDU is acknowledged
with an AK TPDU.
.IP
TPACK_WINDOW
means that upon receipt of the packet that represents
the high edge of the last window advertised, and AK TPDU is generated.

.TP 25
p_rx_strat
4 bit mask
[ TPRX_USE_CW | TPRX_FASTSTART over
connectionless network protocols ]
[ TPRX_USE_CW over
connection-oriented network protocols ]
.IP
This parameter applies only to class 4.
The bit mask may include the following values:
.IP
TPRX_EACH: When a retransmission timer expires, retransmit
each packet in the send window rather than
just the first unacknowledged packet.
.IP
TPRX_USE_CW: Use a "congestion window" strategy borrowed
from Van Jacobson's congestion window strategy for TCP.
The congestion window size is set to one whenever
a retransmission occurs.
.IP
TPRX_FASTSTART: Begin sending the maximum amount of data permitted
by the peer (subject to availability).
The alternative is to start sending slowly by 
pretending the peer's window is smaller than it is, and letting
it slowly grow up to the real peer's window size.
This is to smooth the effect of new connections on a congested network
by preventing a transport connection from suddenly 
overloading the network with a burst of packets.
This strategy is also due to Van Jacobson.

.TP 25
p_class
5 bit mask
[ TP_CLASS_4 | TP_CLASS_0 ]

.PP
In the kernel source, many files have changed or been added.
For a list of these, see the installation guide,
"Installing Wisconsin ARGO 1.0 on Academic Operating System 4.3
Release 2".
.SH "ERROR VALUES
.PP
The TP entity returns \fIerrno\fR error values as defined in
\fB<sys/errno.h>\fR
and
\fB<netargo/iso_errno.h>\fR.
User programs may print messages associated with these value by
using an expanded version of \fIperror()\fR
found in the ISO library, \fIlibisodir.a\fR.
.PP
If the TP entity encounters asynchronous events
that will cause a transport connection to be closed,
such as
timing out while retransmitting a connect request TPDU,
or receiving a DR TPDU,
the TP entity issues a SIGURG signal, indicating that
disconnection has occurred.
If the signal is issued during a 
a system call, the system call may be interrupted,
in which case the
\fIerrno\fR value upon return from the system call is EINTR.
If the signal SIGURG
is being handled by reading
from the socket, and it was a \fIaccept()\fR that
timed out, the read may result in ENOTSOCK,
because the \fIaccept()\fR call had not yet returned a
legitimate socket descriptor when the signal was handled.
ETIMEDOUT (or a some other errno value appropriate to the
type of error) is returned if SIGURG is blocked
for the duration of the system call.
A user program should take one of the following approaches:
.IP "Block SIGURG." 5
If the program is servicing
only one connection, it can block or ignore SIGURG during connection 
establishment.
The advantage of this is that the \fIerrno\fR value
returned is somewhat meaningful.
The disadvantage of this is that
if ignored, disconnection and expedited data indications could be
missed.
For some programs this is not a problem.
.IP "Handle SIGURG." 5
If the program is servicing more than one connection at a time
or expedited data may arrive or both, the program must
service SIGURG.
It can use the \fIgetsockopt(...TPOPT_FLAGS...)\fR system 
call to see if the signal
was due to the arrival of expedited data or due to a disconnection.
In the latter case, 
\fIgetsockopt()\fR
will return ENOTCONN.
.SH BUGS
.PP
When running TP over the token ring, if checksumming
is NOT used, the TP entity sents packets to the lan driver faster than
the driver can reasonably handle them.
A bug in the lan driver causes it to reorder the packets in this
situation, causing an overall degradation of TP performance.
In general, this is not a problem because very few applications
will actually be able to send packets this fast.
Nevertheless,
in order to prevent this reordering, 
one may induce a delay in the TP entity by setting the 1-byte
value
\fItp_delay\fR
to 1
using the debugger.
Hit the <pause> key, then
type \fB/b tp_delay\fR followed by the <enter key>.
The debugger will print the value 00.  
You then type \fB1\fR followed by the <enter key>.
Then type \fBend\fR <enter key>.
Then type \fBgo\fR <enter key>.
