.Dt SERVICES_MKDB 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm services_mkdb
.Nd generate the services databases
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl qv
.Op Fl o Ar database
.Op Fl V Ar style
.Op Ar file
.Nm
.Fl u
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
creates a
.Xr db 3
database for the specified file.
If no file is specified, then
.Pa /etc/services
is used.
The database is installed into
.Pa /var/db/services.cdb
for CDB format and into
.Pa /var/db/services.db
for DB format (see
.Fl V ) .
The file must be in the correct format (see
.Xr services 5 ) .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl o Ar database
Put the output databases in the named file.
.It Fl q
Don't warn about duplicate services.
This is the default behavior.
.It Fl u
Print the services file to stdout, omitting duplicate entries and comments.
.It Fl V
Create a specific version of the database style.
.Ar style
can be
.Li cdb
to request the CDB format (default) or
.Li db
to request the DB format.
The DB format is useful for compatibility with old statically
linked binaries.
.It Fl v
Warn about duplicate services.
.El
.Pp
The databases are used by the C library services routines (see
.Xr getservent 3 ) .
.Pp
.Nm
exits zero on success, non-zero on failure.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width 24n -compact
.It Pa /var/db/services.db
The current services database.
.It Pa /var/db/services.db.tmp
A temporary file.
.It Pa /etc/services
The current services file.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr db 3 ,
.Xr getservent 3 ,
.Xr services 5
.Sh BUGS
Because
.Nm
guarantees not to install a partial destination file it must
build a temporary file in the same file system and if successful use
.Xr rename 2
to install over the destination file.
.Pp
If
.Nm
fails it will leave the previous version of the destination file intact.
