	* README: Bumped the version.
	* configure.in: Bumped the version.
	* ndbootd.c (main): Don't assume that a successful, but short, read
	leaves a zero in errno.  Instead, just check for the short
	read by looking at the byte count that read returned.

Wed May 23 02:37:40 2001  Matthew Fredette  <fredette@alum.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Bumped the version.

Wed May 23 02:35:49 2001  Matthew Fredette  <fredette@alum.mit.edu>

	* Release 0.4 out.
	* configure.in: Bumped the version.
	* ndbootd.c: Changed many debugging printfs to compile quietly on the
	alpha.  Patch from Andrew Brown <atatat@atatdot.net>.

	* config/ndbootd-bpf.c: Changed many debugging printfs to compile quietly on the
	alpha.  Patch from Andrew Brown <atatat@atatdot.net>.

Tue May 22 13:13:24 2001  Matthew Fredette  <fredette@alum.mit.edu>

	* Release 0.3 out.
	* acconfig.h: Added coverage for macros with alignment information.
	* acinclude.m4 (AC_CHECK_ALIGNOF): Added.
	* configure.in: Bumped the version number.
	Now use AC_CHECK_ALIGNOF to check for the minimum
	alignment of a 32-bit int; if it isn't 1, compile
	ndbootd for a strict-alignment machine.

	* ndbootd.c Ran indent(1) with NetBSD's KNF-approximating profile.
	* ndbootd.c: [HAVE_STRICT_ALIGNMENT]: Added code to copy packet headers
	between the buffer and local variables, to satisfy
	alignment constraints.

	* ndbootd.h Ran indent(1) with NetBSD's KNF-approximating profile.
	* config/ndbootd-bpf.c Ran indent(1) with NetBSD's KNF-approximating profile.

	* configure.in: Bumped up the version.

Tue May 15 14:43:24 2001  Matthew Fredette  <fredette@alum.mit.edu>

	* Release 0.2 out.
	* configure.in: Bumped up the version.
	* ndbootd.8: Some formatting changes.
	* ndbootd.c: Now have prototypes for the allocation functions.
	(main): Now handle boot blocks that aren't an integral
	multiple of the block size.

Wed May 09 20:50:46 2001  Matthew Fredette  <fredette@alum.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added support for the man page.
	* README: Updated the usage to reflect the new single-letter option names.
	* ndbootd.8: Added.
	* ndbootd.c (main): Now insert a small delay before sending each packet.
	Sending packets too quickly apparently overwhelms clients.
	Added new single-letter versions of all options that didn't
	already have them.  Expanded some debug messages, and fixed
	others to display Ethernet addresses correctly.

	* config/ndbootd-bpf.c: Removed an unnecessary comment.

Wed Jan 31 17:35:50 2001  Matthew Fredette  <fredette@alum.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added the ChangeLog to EXTRA_DIST.
	* README: Updated.
	* ndbootd.c (main): Fixed various printf argument lists.

Wed Jan 31 17:35:16 2001  Matthew Fredette  <fredette@alum.mit.edu>

	* Release 0.1 out.
	* Makefile.am: Added the ChangeLog to EXTRA_DIST.
	* README: Updated.
	* ndbootd.c (main): Fixed various printf argument lists.
	* ndbootd.h: Now include param.h.

Tue Jan 30 15:35:38 2001  Matthew Fredette  <fredette@alum.mit.edu>

	* README: Added.
	* ndbootd.c: Now, ndbootd assembles disk images for clients on-the-fly.
	Defined many new macros related to this.
	(main): Added support for the --boot2 option.  Turned the
	original disk-image filename into the filename of the
	first-stage boot program.  Now do better multiple-client
	support, especially when it comes to checking if a client
	is really ours.  Now assemble client-specific disk images
	on-the-fly, potentially serving each client a different
	second-stage boot.

Mon Jan 29 15:12:13 2001  Matthew Fredette  <fredette@alum.mit.edu>

	* COPYING: Added.
	* Makefile.am: Added.
	* acconfig.h: Added.
	* acinclude.m4: Added.
	* configure.in: Added.
