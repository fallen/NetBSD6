<h1>Timing Tests</h1>

<p>
	This section describes timing tests and their results. The tests were
performed on two systems:
</p>
<ol>
	<li> </li>
	<li> Intel </li>
</ol>

<p>
	The tests are organized as follows:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href = "#hash_based">Hash-Based Container Tests</a>
	shows tests pertaining to hash-based containers.
	</li>
	<li><a href = "#hash_based">Tree-Based Container Tests</a>
	shows tests pertaining to tree-based containers.
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Random-Integer Find Test</h3>

<p>
	This test measurs the average time to find an entry
in a &quot;set&quot; as a function of the &quot;set&quot;'s
size.</p>
_
<p>
	The test's purpose is to find the effect of
different range-hashing functions. See
<a href = "hash_based_containers.html#hash_policies">Hash-Based Containers::Resize Policies</a>
