<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>


<ol>
	<li>This library was written at the <a href = "http://www.haifa.il.ibm.com/dept/storage/network.html">Network Storage Technologies</a> Group of
<a href = "http://www.haifa.il.ibm.com/">IBM's Haifa Research Labs</a>.</li>
	<li>The library is based heavily on policy-based design and uses many useful
techniques from [<a href="references.html#knuth98sorting">alexandrescu01modern</a>].
	</li>
	<li> Two ideas are borrowed from the SGI-STL implementation [<a href = "references.html#sgi_stl">sgi_stl</a>]:
	<ol>
		<li>
			The prime-based resize policies use a list of primes taken from the SGI-STL implementation.
		</li>
		<li> The red-black trees contain both a root node and a header
	node (containing metadata), connected in a way
	that forward and reverse iteration can be performed efficiently.
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li> Some test utilities borrow ideas from [<a href = "references.html#boost_timer">boost_timer</a>].
	</li>
	<li> We would like to thank Scott Meyers for useful comments (without attributing to him
	any flaws in the design or implementation of the library).
	</li>
	<li> Much of the documentation is
