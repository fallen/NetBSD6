/* Structure for recording edge equivalences as well as any pending
   edge redirections during the dominator optimizer.

   Computing and storing the edge equivalences instead of creating
   them on-demand can save significant amounts of time, particularly
   for pathological cases involving switch statements.  

   These structures live for a single iteration of the dominator
   optimizer in the edge's AUX field.  At the end of an iteration we
   free each of these structures and update the AUX field to point
   to any requested redirection target (the code for updating the
   CFG and SSA graph for edge redirection expects redirection edge
   targets to be in the AUX field for each edge.  */

/* Value range propagation record.  Each time we encounter a conditional
   of the form SSA_NAME COND CONST we create a new vrp_element to record
   how the condition affects the possible values SSA_NAME may have.

   Each record contains the condition tested (COND), and the range of
   values the variable may legitimately have if COND is true.  Note the
   range of values may be a smaller range than COND specifies if we have
   recorded other ranges for this variable.  Each record also contains the
   block in which the range was recorded for invalidation purposes.

   Note that the current known range is computed lazily.  This allows us
   to avoid the overhead of computing ranges which are never queried.

   When we encounter a conditional, we look for records which constrain
   the SSA_NAME used in the condition.  In some cases those records allow
   us to determine the condition's result at compile time.  In other cases
   they may allow us to simplify the condition.

   We also use value ranges to do things like transform signed div/mod
   operations into unsigned div/mod or to simplify ABS_EXPRs. 

   Simple experiments have shown these optimizations to not be all that
   useful on switch statements (much to my surprise).  So switch statement
   optimizations are not performed.

   Note carefully we do not propagate information through each statement
   in the block.  i.e., if we know variable X has a value defined of
   [0, 25] and we encounter Y = X + 1, we do not track a value range
   for Y (which would be [1, 26] if we cared).  Similarly we do not
   constrain values as we encounter narrowing typecasts, etc.  */
