This file lists the bugs you must be aware of.  Be sure to check this
file before using Autoconf, and especially CVS versions of Autoconf.

Autoconf must not be used in production if there are ``Serious'' bugs,
and use with caution an Autoconf with ``Important bugs''.

Many other bugs are registered on the GNATS server:

Please, don't register bugs listed below: we already know we have to
address them.
