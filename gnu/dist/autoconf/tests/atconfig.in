# This script is part of Autotest.  Unlimited permission to copy,

# material that constitutes the Autotest.
#
# Certain portions of the Autotest source text are designed to be
# copied (in certain cases, depending on the input) into the output of
# Autotest.  We call these the "data" portions.  The rest of the
# Autotest source text consists of comments plus executable code that
# decides which of the data portions to output in any given case.  We
# call these comments and executable code the "non-data" portions.
# Autotest never copies any of the non-data portions into its output.
#
# This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autotest
# released by the Free Software Foundation.  When you make and
# distribute a modified version of Autotest, you may extend this
# special exception to the GPL to apply to your modified version as
# well, *unless* your modified version has the potential to copy into
# its output some of the text that was the non-data portion of the
# version that you started with.  (In other words, unless your change
# moves or copies text from the non-data portions to the data
# portions.)  If your modification has such potential, you must delete
# any notice of this special exception to the GPL from your modified
# version.
