LM32 port TODO:

- add some libkern features
- add crtstuff in libcsu
- verify frame.h
- make _spl() functions less nazi (don't mask all IRQs when it's not necessary)
- make sure it's fine to hardwire CLKF_USERMOD to 0 or 1 (this and the following one seem to be used for statistics purposes only)
- make sure it's fine to hardwire CLKF_INTR to 0 or 1
- Do I need to implement cpu_did_resched() ?
