# Structure of this file:
#
# + an extent is a straight (offset, length) pair of a file or device
#   it's the lowest common storage denominator
#   at least one is needed
# + a device is made up of one or more extents or other devices
#   devices can be added in a hierachical manner, to enhance resilience
# + in this example, no device definitions are necessary, as the target
#   will just use a simple extent for persistent storage
# + a target is made up of 1 or more devices
# The code does not support RAID1 recovery at present

# Simple file showing 1 extent, mapped straight into 1 target

# extent	file or device		start		length
extent0		/tmp/iscsi-target0	0		100MB

# target	flags	storage		netmask
target0		rw	extent0		0.0.0.0/0
