There are two different installation procedures for
.Nx*M .
The first procedure is used when the
.Nx*M
installation will run as the privileged domain-0.
The second procedure is used for preparing a
.Nx*M
installation to be run as a non-privileged domain.
.
.Pp
For a privileged domain-0 installation, you have to first install
.Nx Ns /i386 .
The
.Nx Ns /i386
distribution and installation instructions are available at
.Lk ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-\*V/i386/
.
.Pp
For a non-privileged installation, you have to first install Xen
and another OS as domain-0, including the domain tools.  Refer to the
Xen website at:
