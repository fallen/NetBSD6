.\" --------- MD instructions on setting up boot media
.
You will have to prepare the `ramdisk-root' installation system.
There are two ways to invoke the
.Nx
installation system;
.Pp
.(bullet -compact -offset indent
Use the
.Pa loadbsd.x
utility to boot
.Nx
from
.Tn Human68k
.It
Make a boot floppy which contains the installation system
.bullet)
.Pp
If you choose the first method,
you have to put the compressed installation kernel
.Pa netbsd-INSTALL.gz ,
the
.Pa loadbsd.x
utility and the
.Pa gzip.x
utility to a disk accessible from Human68k.
These files can be found in the
.Pa x68k/binary/kernel
directory or
.Pa x68k/installation/misc
directory of the
.Nx
distribution.
The
.Pa netbsd-INSTALL
file needs to be uncompressed from
.Pa netbsd-INSTALL.gz
using the provided
.Ic gzip.x
program with the
.Fl d
switch. 
.Pp
To invoke the installation system, just type
.Pp
.Dl Ic "gzip.x -d netbsd-INSTALL.gz"
.Dl Ic "loadbsd.x netbsd-INSTALL"
.Pp
from the
.Tn Human68k
command line.
.Pp
If you choose the second method, you have to make the boot floppy
from the floppy image
.Pa sysinst.fs .
The image file can be found in
.Pa x68k/installation/floppy
directory of the
.Nx
distribution.
.Pp
If you are using a
.Ul
system to write the floppy image to
disks, you should use the
.Pa dd
command to copy the file system images (.fs files) directly to the raw
floppy disks.
It is suggested that you read the
.Xr dd 1
manual page or
ask your system administrator to determine the correct set of
arguments to use; it will be slightly different from system to system,
and a comprehensive list of the possibilities is beyond the scope of
this document.
.Pp
If you are using
.Tn Human68k
to write the floppy images to disks, you should use the
.Ic rawrite
utility, provided in the
.Pa x68k/installation/misc
directory of the
.Nx
distribution.
PC versions can be found in
.Pa i386/installation/misc .
It will write the file system images (.fs files) to disks.
.Pp
To use the boot floppy, insert the floppy to your floppy drive 0,
and reboot your computer with OPT.1 key pressed.
.Pp
If you have less than 5MB of memory, you have to use the
`floppy-root' installation system instead of the above
`ramdisk-root' installation system.
`Floppy-root' installation
system is composed of two floppies, `kern' and `inst'.
They are made from the floppy images
.Pa kern.fs
and
.Pa inst.fs
respectively, both of which are found in
.Pa installation/floppy
directory of the
.Nx
distribution.
The
.Pa inst.fs
file needs to be uncompressed from
.Pa inst.fs.gz
using the provided
.Ic gzip.x
program with the
.Fl d
switch. 
See above how to write the images to floppies.
.Pp
To start the `floppy-root' installation system, insert the `kern' floppy
to your floppy drive 0, and reboot your computer with OPT.1 key pressed.
When you are prompted that `Insert file system floppy and press return.',
replace the `kern' floppy with `inst' floppy and press return key.
.Pp
Once booted, the `floppy-root' installation system is identical with
the `ramdisk-root' installation system, except that the former constantly
accesses the floppy disk.
Floppy disks are relatively unreliable media and cause some warning messages
to report access errors, most of which are corrected and can be ignored.
With the latter installation system the floppy disk is not used once the
system has booted off and can be removed from the drive.
.Pp
.(Note
The `floppy-root' installation system cannot be used to install
.Nx*M
on a machine with less than 5MB of memory.
