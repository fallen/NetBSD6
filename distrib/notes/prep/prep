When installing
.Nx
for your
.Nx \*V
system, you will have to create a PReP boot partition on your primary boot
drive.
Sysinst will handle this automatically for you if you tell it to use the
whole disk for NetBSD.
Doing so will delete any partitions and information on that disk.
It may be possible to manually partition a disk such that you could dual-boot
AIX, but it would likely be very difficult.
If you wish to retain AIX, you will likely have to install
.Nx
onto a separate drive.
.Nx
requires a PReP boot partition of at least 2 MB in size.
It is recommended that the partition be at least 5 MB in size to allow for
future growth.
The PReP boot partition must be marked as the active partition.
Do not mark the
.Nx
partition as active.
