Sun2 machines usually need little or no preparation before installing
NetBSD, other than the usual, well advised precaution of
.Em backing up all data
on any attached storage devices.
.Pp
You will need to know the SCSI target ID of the drive on which you
will install
.Nx .
.(Note
.Tn SunOS
on the \*M uses confusing names for
the SCSI devices: target 1 is
.Li sd2 ,
target 2 is
.Li sd4 ,
etc.
