.\" ---------- MD instructions on setting up boot media
.
First-time installation on a bare machine is not supported, because most
DECstations do not have any suitable load device.
Some versions of the DECstation PROM are buggy and will not boot via
.Tn TFTP
and bootp; other versions are buggy and do not boot via
.Tn MOP .
.Pp
The only DECstation with a floppy-disk drive is the Personal DECstation,
and that device is not supported as a boot device.
.Pp
The recommended installation procedure is to boot an install kernel
via
.Tn TFTP ,
or to use a
.Dq helper
system to write a miniroot diskimage onto a disk, move that
disk to the target installation system, and then boot the miniroot.
