To start installation, you have to put
.Dq Pa netbsd
kernel prepared in
.Pa installation
directory into some folder on
.Tn Windows CE
and boot it using bootloader
.Pq Pa hpcboot-sh3.exe No or Pa hpcboot-sh4.exe .
On
.Pa hpcboot
window, you have to specify a folder name your kernel is stored,
your kernel name, and your machine type.
You can also specify some options for debug.
.Pp
Once the installation kernel is loaded by
.Pa hpcboot
properly,
.Ic sysinst
will automatically start.
.Pp
The
.Nx*M
kernel and system install consume about 7 MB of memory.
Please configure the
.Tn "Windows CE"
memory setting to allow this amount of
memory to be used.
If bootloader failed with a
.Dq cannot allocate heap
error, configure more RAM for memory and less for disk with the dialog at
[Setting]-\*[Gt][ControlPanel]-\*[Gt][System]-\*[Gt][Memory] under
.Tn "Windows CE" .
