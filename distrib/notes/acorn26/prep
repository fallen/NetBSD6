If you're planning on installing
.Nx*M
on a hard disk, first make sure it's supported (see above).
Then make sure there's nothing you want to keep on it, since
.Nx*M 's
ability to share a hard disk with RISC OS is at best untested.

Alternatively,
.Nx*M
can be made to run diskless, getting all its file systems from an NFS server.
