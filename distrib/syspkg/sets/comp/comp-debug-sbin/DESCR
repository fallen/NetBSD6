This package contains kgmon, a kernel debugging utility. kgmon is a tool
used when profiling the operating system. When no arguments are supplied,
kgmon indicates the state of operating system profiling as running, off,
or not configured. (see config(8)) If the -p flag is specified, kgmon
extracts profile data from the operating system and produces a gmon.out
file suitable for later analysis by gprof(1).
