This package contains the man pages groff source on various C programming
debugging utilities, such as:

	addr2line - translates program addresses into file names and line
	numbers. Given an address and an executable, it uses the debugging
	information in the executable to figure out which file name and
	line number are associated with a given address;

	gcov - displays basic block profile / coverage data, if requested
	via the C compiler gcc(1) command line options -fprofile-arcs and
	-ftest-coverage. These options cause the compiler to insert
	instrumentation into the object files it generates, which measure
	how often each basic block is executed; 

	gdb - is the GNU debugger. The purpose of a debugger such as GDB
	is to allow you to see what is going on ``inside'' another program
	while it executes, or what another program was doing at the moment
	it crashed;

	gprof - displays call graph profile data. gprof produces an
	execution profile of C, Pascal, or Fortran77 programs.
