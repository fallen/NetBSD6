This package contains formatted manual pages for compilers and tools for
the FORTRAN programming language, which include:

	asa - interpret carriage-control characters. The asa utility reads
	files sequentially, mapping FORTRAN carriage-control characters
	to line-printer control sequences, and writes them to the standard
	output;

	f77, fort77, g77 - GNU project Fortran Compiler (v0.5.24). The C
	and F77 compilers are integrated; g77 is a program to call gcc
	with options to recognize programs written in Fortran (ANSI
	FORTRAN 77, also called F77). gcc processes input files through
	one or more of four stages: prepro- cessing, compilation,
	assembly, and linking. This man page contains full descriptions
	for only F77-specific aspects of the compiler, though it also
	contains summaries of some general-purpose options. For a fuller
	explanation of the compiler, see gcc(1);

	fpr - print Fortran file utility. fpr is a filter that transforms
	files formatted according to Fortran's carriage control
	conventions into files formatted according to UNIX line printer
	conventions.
