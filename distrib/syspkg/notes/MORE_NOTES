A few things have solidified since the previous documents in this directory.
This document will serve to contain late-breaking news until the other
documents can be updated.

Package names
-------------

Package names are of the following form:

	<set>-<pkg>-<part>

<set> 	is always the containing set.
<pkg> 	is the software component (util, sendmail, games)
<part> 	is a division of a package into parts.  This allows
	users to normally install all parts, but specialize
	if desired.

SUSHI and sysinst will be made aware of this naming scheme, so that they
can be made to offer, eg, to allow users to install `rcs' or to zoom
in and install `base-rcs-bin' and not `base-rcs-man'.  This is in addition
to the bundling of packages into `package sets' corresponding to the
existing tarball sets for rapid sysinst-based installs.

Package Divisions
-----------------

The following strategy is being taken for division of the `base' package.

First off, utilities are divided into a few big packages based on the following:

	directories	base-sys-root, base-sys-usr
	/bin		base-util-root
	/sbin		base-sysutil-root
	/usr/bin	base-util-bin
	/usr/lib	base-sys-shlib
	/usr/sbin	base-sysutil-bin

supporting files are named based on the utilities they match (with the <part> changed).

Then, groups of utilities which are either likely to not be installed (UUCP, SLIP) or
distinct from other utilities (postfix, sendmail, bind) are separated from the above.
