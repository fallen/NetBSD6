.TH VGIMPORTCLONE 8 "LVM TOOLS #VERSION#" "Red Hat, Inc." \" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
vgimportclone \- import and rename duplicated volume group (e.g. a hardware snapshot)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vgimportclone
[\-n|\-\-basevgname VolumeGroupName]
[\-i|\-\-import]
PhysicalVolume [PhysicalVolume...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vgimportclone
is used to import a duplicated VG (e.g. hardware snapshot).  Duplicate VG(s)
and PV(s) are not able to be used until they are made to coexist with
the origin VG(s) and PV(s).   
.B vgimportclone 
renames the VG associated with the specified PV(s) and changes the
associated VG and PV UUIDs.
.SH OPTIONS
See \fBlvm\fP for common options.
.TP
.I \-n|\-\-basevgname VolumeGroupName
By default the snapshot VG will be renamed to the original name plus a
numeric suffix to avoid duplicate naming (e.g. 'test_vg' would be renamed
to 'test_vg1').  This option will override the base VG name that is
used for all VG renames.  If a VG already exists with the specified name
a numeric suffix will be added (like the previous example) to make it unique.
.TP
.I \-i|\-\-import
Import exported Volume Groups.  Otherwise VGs that have been exported
will not be changed (nor will their associated PVs).
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
\fBLVM_BINARY\fP
The LVM2 binary to use.
Defaults to "lvm".
.SH EXAMPLES
If origin VG
.B test_vg 
has PVs 
.BR /dev/loop0 " and " /dev/loop1
and 
.BR /dev/loop2 " and " /dev/loop3
are respective snapshot PVs of the origin PVs.
To rename the VG
associated with
.BR /dev/loop2 " and " /dev/loop3
from
.B test_vg
to
.B test_vg_snap
(and change associated VG and PV UUIDs):
.nf

\	vgimportclone --basevgname test_vg_snap /dev/loop2 /dev/loop3
