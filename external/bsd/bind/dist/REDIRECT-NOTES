Redirect zones are used to find answers to queries when normal resolution
would result in NXDOMAIN being returned.  Only one redirect zone per view
is currently supported.

To redirect to 100.100.100.2 and 2001:ffff:ffff::100.100.100.2 on NXDOMAIN
one would configure the redirect zone like this.

zone "." {
	type redirect;
	file "redirect.db";
};

redirect.db:
$TTL 300
@ IN SOA ns.example.net hostmaster.example.net 0 0 0 0 0
@ IN NS ns.example.net
;
; NS records do not need address records in this zone as it is not in the
; normal namespace.
;
*. IN A 100.100.100.2
*. IN AAAA 2001:ffff:ffff::100.100.100.2

To redirect all Spanish names (under .ES) one would use entries like these:

*.ES. IN A 100.100.100.3
*.ES. IN AAAA 2001:ffff:ffff::100.100.100.3

To redirect all commercial Spanish names (under COM.ES) one would use
entries like these:
*.COM.ES. IN A 100.100.100.4
*.COM.ES. IN AAAA 2001:ffff:ffff::100.100.100.4

The redirect zone supports all possible types.  It is not limited to
A and AAAA record.
