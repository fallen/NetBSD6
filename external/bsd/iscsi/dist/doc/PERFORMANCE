USER LEVEL PERFORMANCE
----------------------

If your system is correctly configured with GbE and a GHz processor, 
you should expect user level iSCSI performance similar to the following.  
This output was generated by running utest against a target running uramdisk.

KERNEL LEVEL PERFORMANCE
------------------------

Kernel level performance (ktest to kramdisk.o) should be similar to the output
shown below.  Note that this test does not go through the linux storage stack,
but is rather a kernel level iSCSI test with no attached filesystem or SCSI
midlayer.

This output was generated by installing the module intel_iscsi.o and then 
running "ktest <device>" where <device> is one of your iscsi devices (e.g, 
/dev/sdb).  Although you specify a single device on the command line, all 
target devices are tested.
