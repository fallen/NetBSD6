.SH NAME
slapo\-sssvlv \- Server Side Sorting and Virtual List View overlay to slapd
.SH SYNOPSIS
ETCDIR/slapd.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
This overlay implements the LDAP Server Side Sorting (RFC2891) control
as well as the Virtual List View control. It also replaces the default
implementation of the LDAP PagedResults (RFC2696) control, to ensure
that it works with Sorting. The overlay can be used with any backend
or globally for all backends.

Since a complete result set must be generated in memory before sorting can
be performed, processing sort requests can have a large impact on the
server's memory use. As such, any connection is limited to having only
one sort request active at a time. Additional limits may be configured
as described below.

.SH CONFIGURATION
These
.B slapd.conf
options apply to the SSSVLV overlay.
They should appear after the
