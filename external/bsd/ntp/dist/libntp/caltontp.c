/*
 * Juergen Perlinger, 2008-11-12
 * Add support for full calendar calculatios. If the day-of-year is provided
 * (that is, not zero) it will be used instead of month and day-of-month;
 * otherwise a full turn through the calendar calculations will be taken.
 *
 * I know that Harlan Stenn likes to see assertions in production code, and I
 * agree there, but it would be a tricky thing here. The algorithm is quite
 * capable of producing sensible answers even to seemingly weird inputs: the
 * date <any year here>-03-00, the 0.th March of the year, will be automtically
 * treated as the last day of February, no matter whether the year is a leap
 * year or not. So adding constraints is merely for the benefit of the callers,
 * because the only thing we can check for consistency is our input, produced
 * by somebody else.
 *
 * BTW: A total roundtrip using 'caljulian' would be a quite shaky thing:
 * Because of the truncation of the NTP time stamp to 32 bits and the epoch
 * unfolding around the current time done by 'caljulian' the roundtrip does
 * *not* necessarily reproduce the input, especially if the time spec is more
 * than 68 years off from the current time...
