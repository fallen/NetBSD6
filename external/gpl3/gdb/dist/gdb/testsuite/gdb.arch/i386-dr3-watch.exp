# x86 and amd64 gdbserver had a bug where a watchpoint triggered by
# the DR3 debug register would trip on a bogus assertion.

# This test relies on being able to set 4 hardware watchpoints.  Since
# that is not a valid assumption across most targets, and we're
# testing a x86 specific bug, skip everywhere else.
