                        Installing MPC
                        ==============

This is for the impatient, for deeper explanations see Installing MPC chapter
in the Texinfo documentation (type 'info mpc.info').

0. You first need to install GMP and MPFR. See <http://gmplib.org/>
   and <http://www.mpfr.org>.
   MPC requires GMP version 4.3.2 or later and MPFR version 2.4.2 or later.

1. In the directory of the MPC archive, type

      tar xzf mpc-0.9.tar.gz
      cd mpc-0.9
      ./configure
      make

   This assumes that GMP and MPFR are installed in a directory searched by
   default by the compiler. Otherwise, use --with-gmp=DIR or --with-mpfr=DIR
   (see the Texinfo documentation).

2. You can optionally run the test suit, type

      make check

3. To install the MPC library, type

      make install

      By default, the files are copied into /usr/local subdirectories. You
      need write permissions on these directories.

4. You can optionally create documentation, type

      make dvi

   or

      make ps

   This requires the Texinfo package (version 4.2 at least).

Note for AIX users:
===================

If GMP was built with the 64-bit ABI, before building and testing MPC,
it might be necessary to set the OBJECT_MODE environment variable to 64
by, e.g.,
   export OBJECT_MODE=64
This has been tested with the C compiler IBM XL C/C++ Enterprise Edition
V8.0 for AIX, version: 08.00.0000.0021, GMP 4.2.4 and MPFR 2.4.1.

Note for Windows users:
=======================

There is a special file Makefile.vc for Windows, contributed by Mickael
Gastineau. This file works both for the Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK,
and for the Windows SDK of Vista. To use it, simply replace "make" by
"nmake /f makefile.vc" in the above instructions:

compilation :
nmake /f makefile.vc GMP=<gmp_install_dir> MPFR=<mpfr_install_dir>

clean :
nmake /f makefile.vc GMP=<gmp_install_dir> MPFR=<mpfr_install_dir> clean

check :
nmake /f makefile.vc GMP=<gmp_install_dir> MPFR=<mpfr_install_dir> check

For any issue related to the makefile.vc file, please contact directly
Mickael Gastineau at <gastineau at imcce dot fr> (replace 'at' by '@',
and 'dot' by '.').

If you want to compile mpc with mingw in the msys shell, you might need to
add the following to the configure command (or in your environment):

LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
