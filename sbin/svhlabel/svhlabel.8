.Sh NAME
.Nm svhlabel
.Nd update disk label from SGI Volume Header
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl fqrw
.Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to update a
.Nx
disk label from the Silicon Graphics Volume Header
on disks that were previously used on IRIX systems.
.Pp
.Nm
scans the Volume Header contained in the first blocks of the disk
and generates additional partition entries for the disk from the
entries found.
.Pp
Each Volume Header entry which does not have an equivalent partition
in the disk label (equivalent in having the same size and offset) is
added to the first free partition slot in the disk label.
A free partition slot is defined as one with an
.Dv fstype
of
.Sq Li unused
and a
.Dv size
of zero
.Pq Sq 0 .
If there are not enough free slots in the disk label, a warning
will be issued.
.Pp
The raw partition (typically partition
.Em c ,
but
.Em d
on i386 and some other platforms) is left alone during this process.
.Pp
By default, the proposed changed disk label will be displayed and no
disk label update will occur.
.Pp
Available options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width sX
.It Fl f
Force an update, even if there has been no change.
.It Fl q
Performs operations in a quiet fashion.
.It Fl r

.Fl w ,

You probably do not want to do this.
.It Fl w
Update the in-core label if it has been changed.
