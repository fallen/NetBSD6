.Sh NAME
.Nm apmlabel
.Nd update disk label from Apple Partition Map
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl fqrw
.Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to update a
.Nx
disk label from the Apple Partition Map found
on disks that were previously used on Mac OS systems (or
other APM using systems).
.Pp
.Nm
scans the APM contained in the first blocks of the disk and generates
additional partition entries for the disk from the entries found.
Driver and patches partitions are ignored.
.Pp
Each APM entry which does not have an equivalent partition in the
disk label (equivalent in having the same size and offset) is added to
the first free partition slot in the disk label.
A free partition slot is defined as one with an
.Dv fstype
of
.Sq Li unused
and a
.Dv size
of zero
.Pq Sq 0 .
If there are not enough free slots in the disk label, a warning
will be issued.
.Pp
The raw partition (typically partition
.Em c ,
but
.Em d
on i386 and some other platforms) is left alone during this process.
.Pp
By default, the proposed changed disk label will be displayed and no
disk label update will occur.
.Pp
Available options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width sX
.It Fl f
Force an update, even if there has been no change.
.It Fl q
Performs operations in a quiet fashion.
.It Fl r
