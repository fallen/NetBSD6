.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
requests a password from the user, reads it again for verification
and then will normally not relinquish the terminal until the password is
repeated.
There are two other conditions under which it will terminate: it
will timeout after some interval of time and it may be killed by someone
with the appropriate permission.
.Pp
Options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl n
No timeout is used.
The terminal will be locked indefinitely or until current challenge is met.
.It Fl p
A password is not requested, instead the user's current login password
is used.
If the user has an S/Key key, they may also use it
to unlock the terminal.
To do this the user should enter "s/key" at the unlock "Key:" prompt.
The user will then be issued an S/Key challenge to which they may respond
with a six-word S/Key one-time password.
.It Fl t Ar timeout
The time limit (default 15 minutes) is changed to
.Ar timeout
minutes.
