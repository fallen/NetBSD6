1) The Solaris pmap command also has -r, -x, -l, and -F.  One or
more of those may not apply to the way vm is managed under NetBSD,
but the -x option (print resident/shared/private mapping details)
would certainly be interesting to adapt.

2 The rest of the Solaris p* commands (eg, pflags, pcred, pldd,
psig, pstack, pfiles and pwdx (or perhaps not, since they're pretty
much covered by our fstat), pwait, ptree, and ptime) would be nice
to have, too.  Some of them ought to be doable now, but others
(like pwait) will probably be easier once we have kqueue on the
main trunk, and pstack will make much more sense after the nathanw_sa
branch is brought to the head.
