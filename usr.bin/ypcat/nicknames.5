.Dt NICKNAMES 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm nicknames
.Nd map nickname translation file for NIS (YP)
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr ypcat 1 ,
.Xr ypmatch 1 ,
and
.Xr ypwhich 1
commands reference NIS (YP) maps as specified by the user.
Occasionally it is desirable to use a shorthand reference for a
longer map name, hence the
.Nm
file, kept in
.Dq /var/yp/nicknames.
.Pp
The format of the file is
.Pp
.Dl nickname map
.Pp
one pair per line.
The default installed nickname map is as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width protocols -offset indent -compact
.It passwd
passwd.byname
.It group
group.byname
.It networks
networks.byaddr
.It hosts
hosts.byname
.It protocols
protocols.bynumber
.It services
services.byname
.It aliases
aliases.byname
.It ethers
ethers.byname
.It master.passwd
master.passwd.byname
.El
.Pp
A blank or incomplete
.Nm
file will affect any scripts which use nicknames for map lookup,
whereas if the file is simply missing, the default compiled-in list
will be used.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ypcat 1 ,
.Xr ypmatch 1 ,
.Xr ypwhich 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
file first appeared in Solaris 2.4.
