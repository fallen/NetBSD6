# Since cvs does not provide a version number for the entire tree, provide
# identifiers which can be used by external parties to check if the NetBSD
# source tree is of required vintage.
# 
# This file is of the format NAME=date:subdate.  Subdate is incremented
# if there are multiple version bumps during one day and is reset to 0
# when date is bumped.
